## Welcome to my ePortfolio

Hi, welcome to my ePortfolio. I have created this as I embark on an MSc in Data Science with the University of Essex. I am coming into the data science and computer science field as a complete beginner so hopefully this site will document my growth from knowing next to nothing to being in a position to complete my postgraduate degree and move into employment within the field.
I have worked for the past 20 years within the control centre of an emergency ambulance service. I have undertaken a number of different operational roles, from initially answering and processing the incoming 999 calls before moving on to dispatching and communicating with the ambulances, ensuring that all patients recieved the appropriate level of care in the shortest possible timeframe. For the past 15 years I have been in a number of different managerial roles within the control room, currently working as the duty manager, which involves having oversight of all of the call handlers and dispatch staff on duty at any one time, ensuring that the patients receive the best care and patient experience possible.
I am looking to expand my knowledge further, having already completed an undergraduate degree in Law while in my current role and I am hoping that data science may be the field I can progress my career in down the line.
